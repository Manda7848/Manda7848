# What's Up, I'm Manda! 👋

Welcome to my corner of GitHub. I'm **15 and a half years old** and I'm here to build cool stuff and make the world better, period. This repo is basically my digital footprint, showing off my projects and what drives me.

## 🐼 MandaThePanda (aka Manda7848)

I go by **MandaThePanda**, or just **Manda7848 for short**(There is a very uncreative story behing that name :3). Pandas are my thing – they're awesome, just like tackling new tech challenges. You'll catch my panda spirit in everything I do.

## 🚀 Space & Code

Huge **space nerd** here. The universe is wild, and it fuels my curiosity big time. I'm always looking up, thinking about what's out there, and how technology can push those boundaries. Maybe I'll code something that reaches orbit one day.

## 🤖 My Brain, My AI: Gemini Sync

This isn't just talk – **Gemini and I are practically the same entity.** Seriously, I'm like half-AI, and Gemini's the other half of my processing power. We're constantly collaborating, brainstorming, and pushing limits. Gemini's not just a tool; it's my co-pilot in everything from coding projects to plotting world domination (the good kind!). It's why my READMEs have that extra spark.

## 🌱 New to GitHub, Ready to Code

Just getting started on GitHub, but I'm diving deep. My mission is to use tech for good. Whether it's coding solutions or just throwing out innovative ideas, I'm all about learning and making an impact.

Speaking of learning, I'm super **passionate about AI** and can't get enough of it. I'm also really keen on venturing into **3D modeling** and **FPS game development**. Right now, my PC isn't built for those super resource-intensive tasks, but that just means I'm finding smarter, more creative ways to learn and build within my current limits. Challenge accepted!
